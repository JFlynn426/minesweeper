For minesweeper I learned about several technologies that were new to me at the time. I learned about react and it's ability to update the DOM in an efficient manner. Using state management it was easier to update the minesweeper board and to map out a variable number of cells which differed depending on the difficulty of the game that was chosen. I learned about using the map function to dynamically display the outcome of the game. I also used an api to supply the logic of the game. It was a challenge to learn to send the correct data to the server to change the game status use the api's responses to map out a gui for playing the game.
